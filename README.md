missForest
==========

missForest is a nonparametric, mixed-type imputation method for basically any type of data.  
Here, we host the R-package "missForest" for the statistical software R.  

The method is based on the publication Stekhoven and BÃ¼hlmann, 2012. The R package contains 
a vignette on how to use "missForest" in R including many helpful examples.  Upcoming 
innovations (version 1.5): 

- different stopping criteria (maybe including user defined)
- storage of missForests (if this is feasible, it could be used for predictions)
- housekeeping the code for efficiency 
- repairing the broken vignette (sorry for that)
- random seet tracking/setting for fully reproducible imputation results
- computation time estimation (no promise, just an idea)

Future version of missForest - version 2.0 - will include:

- 'real' multiple imputation (if it works ;-)
